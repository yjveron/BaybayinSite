        <h1>Artifacts Found</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, there is not much existing evidence of Baybayin today. Fortunately, what very little evidence we find were carefully preserved. One such evidence was found along the Lake of Laguna on January 1990. This would, later on, be sold to the National Museum by the Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI).</p>
        <p>Antoon Postma, the founder of the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, posited that the artefacts discovered and preserved have a strong resemblance to artefacts from Indonesia. He noted that the inscriptions on the artefact were records of debts. To add to this, the system of writing resembled an early form of the Kawi Script which originated from Indonesia.</p>
        <p>The Kawi Script was not only used in Java but also in Southeast Asian mainland with little to no variations. The implication of this is that the inscription found in the LCI could have been originated from Central Java since the language used in the inscription is a mixture of Sanskrit words, Old Javanese, and Old-Malay that contains similar words used in Old-Tagalog language  such as ngaran or name and pamgat (pamagat) or title in Tagalog. This signifies that our ancestors had prolonged relations with neighbouring countries.</p>

        <p>One can only wish to know what really happened in the past. Without more historical evidence, there is no way to know how Baybayin, a system of writing that resembled the Kawi script, became the system of writing of the early Tagalogs.</p>
        <p>There are only a handful of written accounts preserved until today which documented Tagalog or any Philippine dialect for that matter. One of these, and the only existing today, is the Doctrina Christiana. It is a compilation of prayers, the Ten Commandments, catechism, etc about the Catholic Church. The book consisted of Spanish writing alongside its Tagalog translations. The Spanish texts were printed in Gothic letters while Tagalog were printed in Baybayin. Early Tagalogs also used Baybayin before as signatures, as evidenced by existing legal documents today. Notarial documents would also contain Baybayin inscriptions.</p>
