        <h1>Pre-colonial Period</h1>
        <p>While Spanish colonizers would want everyone to believe that they were the ones to bring forth civilization in our land, they could not be more wrong. Before the Spanish Colonization era, there were already a handful of systems of writing put in use by the early inhabitants of what would be later called the Republic of the Philippines. Historical evidence cites that Baybayin is one of these systems of writing. Fortunately, Baybayin was historically preserved and documented.</p>
        <p>Baybayin is an ancient script used by the Tagalog people in Central Luzon during the pre-colonial period. Baybayin comes from the Tagalog root word “baybay” meaning “to spell”. The original Baybayin is composed of 3 vowels or patinig and 14 consonants or katinig. </p>
        <p>Unlike the Roman Alphabet which has 5 vowels, Baybayin only has three, mainly A, E/I, and O/U. E/I and O/U share the same character. Baybayin also only has 14 consonants as compared to the 21 of the Roman Alphabet. These are BA, KA, DA/RA, GA, HA, LA, MA, NA, NGA, PA, SA, TA, WA, and YA.</p>

        <h1>Pre-colonial Period</h1>
        <p>The system of writing is simple and quite easy to learn. A dot above the syllabic consonants denotes that its vowel would change from A to E/I. However, a dot below the syllabic consonants means that its vowel would adjust from A to O/U.</p>
        <p>Thanks to Baybayin, the early Tagalogs were able to write poems and announcements using Banana leaves, bamboos, and tree barks. Baybayin’s medium of writing is one factor that brought its demise, aside of course from the openly aggressive obliteration of pre-Hispanic culture by our Spanish colonizers. Only a few well-preserved copies now exist because of the frailty of the materials that they wrote on. </p>
        <p>According to the Boxer Codex of 1590, Baybayin is known by everyone regardless of class. This connotes that most early Tagalogs were literate and had a literary tradition. Unfortunately, most, if not all, were erased from our collective memory by the Spanish colonizers who forced onto Filipinos their own culture while demonizing our very own.</p>
