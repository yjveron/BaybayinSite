        <h1>Colonial Period</h1>
        <p>Because the Spanish colonizers could not understand Baybayin, it was just a matter of time before they introduced their own system --- the Roman Alphabet. Unfortunately, this meant banning all pre-Hispanic forms of writing including Baybayin. This led to a drastic decline in Tagalog script, especially for Filipinos who lived in lowland areas. Early Filipinos who live in easy-to-reach areas had their culture eradicated more quickly than those who lived in remote villages and hard-to-reach areas.</p>
        <p>Mindanao and Palawan, for example, were able to preserve most of their ancient culture, including their scripts and system of writing, because the Spanish colonizers were not able to oppress them as much. Any culture that was foreign to the Spanish were banned. Hundreds of written accounts narrate a regular burning of pre-Hispanic scripts by Spanish friars as they believe they contain evil incantations and curses which could hurt the Friars’ beliefs.</p>

        <h1>Colonial Period</h1>
        <p>Ironically, the system of writing which they were afraid of was also the same system of writing that they used to spread Christianity. Spanish Friars managed to convince the natives to convert to Christianity by using Baybayin as their medium of translation. To make up for the language difference, Baybayin had to be tweaked to translate Spanish words. This reformation of Baybayin came when Fr. Francisco Lopez published an Ilokano Doctrina. One new rule that he introduced to the system of writing was to place a cross mark below the Baybayin characters to cancel the vowel. An example of this could be found in Doctrina Christiana that is still preserved until today.</p>
        <p>On a funny turn of fate, what helped the Spanish colonize us faster also brought its end. Baybayin was used as a uniting force by Andres Bonifacio in 1892. It symbolized the Filipinos’ unity against their oppressors which could be translated to nationalism. Perhaps, the best example of this could be the Katipunan flag of the Magdiwang faction showcased the Baybayin character KA during the Spanish revolution. </p>
        <p>Andres Bonifacio mentions in his poem Ang Dapat Mabatid ng mga Tagalog that the early Tagalogs used to live in prosperity before the Spaniards came. Education was for everyone and everyone was literate with their own native writing systems, including women and children, a dire contrast from the Spanish times.</p>
