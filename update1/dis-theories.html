    <h2>THEORIES AND MODERN USAGE</h2>
    <p>Because of the limited historical resources discussing Baybayin, the mystery on its origin and meaning continues to be a mystery until today. However, this does not stop historians from offering their theories. One such theory was presented by Bonifacio Comandante in his PhD dissertation. He claimed that giants clams played a big role in the development of the native script. Comandante drew this theory due to Baybayin characters sharing some resemblance to the shape of giant clams.</p>

      <h1>THEORIES AND MODERN USAGE</h1>
      <p>Baybayin was also believed to be the “Bathala Code.” It was said that Bathala, the name of the Tagalog Supreme Sky god, was spelt in Baybayin, it was also a representation of a man, woman, and an entity which was the breath of life. The BA character was said to represent the female genitalia. The LA character, on the other hand, showcased a phallic symbol, believed to represent the male genitalia. Both characters are also the starting syllables for their Tagalog translations: BAbae and LAlake. In the middle of these two characters is the HA symbol which represented the divine breath as the character symbolizes wind. The Tagalog counterpart of wind also starts with the syllable HA (HAngin)</p>

      <h1>FILIPINO IDENTITY AND MODERN USAGE</h1>
      <p>Baybayin is being used right now to reclaim the so-called lost Filipino identity in an attempt to reconnect with their roots. This movement also signifies an innate need for a native culture that is inherently Filipino. Baybayin could be used to promote cultural awareness not just only for Baybayin alone but for all native cultural traditions that are disappearing with the turn of the times. Although Baybayin is not used on a day to day basis, it could be seen as inscriptions for Graphic Design, Decorations, Calligraphy, Tattoos, etc.</p>
